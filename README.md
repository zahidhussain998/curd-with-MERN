# CRUD-with-MERN

I built this MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) project to practice CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for learning purposes.

## Project Components

This project uses the following technologies and components:

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing and managing data.
- **Express**: A Node.js web application framework for creating the backend server.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: A runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server.
- **Mongoose**: An elegant MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to your backend API.
- **React Router**: A library for adding routing functionality to your React application.
- **Multer**: A middleware for handling file uploads.
- **Cors**: A package for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing to allow frontend-backend communication.
- **And more...**
